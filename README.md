# my_portfolio
This repo contains my portfolio using html,and CSS 
### Q1:What did you learn while making this app?
While making this app, I learned how to use Git and GitHub, as I hadn't used them before. I learned how to create a new repository, push my project to GitHub, and view it in VS Code. This was also my first time creating a portfolio, so I watched many reference videos and finally built a mini version using HTML and CSS.
### Q2:What feature did you enjoy building the most?
I enjoyed styling the portfolio using CSS the most changing the look and feel, adding buttons, images, and experimenting with different fonts was really fun
### Q3:What would you add next if you had more time?
 If I had more time, I would add interactive features using JavaScript, such as animations, dynamic content etc to make the portfolio more engaging and user-friendly
